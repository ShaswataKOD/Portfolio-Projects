## Data Clening Steps:
Before performing the analysis, the dataset required cleaning and formatting to ensure accuracy and consistency. 
The key steps were:

1. Handling missing values:

    Checked for NULLs across all tables and dropped columns that were mostly empty (placeholder named my_column). This ensured cleaner, more reliable analysis.

2. Standardizing the Experience column in Projects:
    Removed the ($) signs and parentheses from experience levels for easier analysis.

    <pre>UPDATE Projects SET Experience = REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(Experience, '(', ''), ')', ''), '$', ''); </pre>

3. Converting dates and extracting components:

    The Date_Posted column in Projects was in VARCHAR format. It was converted to proper date and time formats, and two new columns were created: Date_Only and Time_Only. 
    <pre>UPDATE Projects
    SET Date_Only = DATE(STR_TO_DATE(Date_Posted, '%d-%m-%Y %H:%i')),
    Time_Only = TIME(STR_TO_DATE(Date_Posted, '%d-%m-%Y %H:%i'));
    </pre>

4. Adding a new column in Clients:

    A new column was created to facilitate analysis (e.g., extracting registration month or day)

## Executive Summary:

Expert-level budgets surge most in Technology & Programming (+560%) and Marketing/Branding (+460%), while Music & Audio (+120%) and Design (+150%) show smaller increases. Niche subcategories like Videography and Mobile App Development, with under 5% of postings, still command the highest total budgets. 

Countries with few but high-value postings include Germany, and Algeria, while US and UK offer scalable high-budget markets. Clients convert fastest to posting in Music & Audio (~3.1 yrs) versus slowest in Business (~4.4 yrs).

Finally, Canada excels in Tech & Digital Marketing, Spain dominates Music, US leads in Business & Creative, UK offers broad small premiums, and India overspends in Marketing

##  Business Insights & Analysis:

### 1. How does experience affect the median project budgets?
```sql
WITH ranked AS (
    SELECT 
        c.CATEGORY_NAME, 
        p.EXPERIENCE,
        p.BUDGET,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY c.CATEGORY_NAME, p.EXPERIENCE ORDER BY p.BUDGET) AS rn,
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY c.CATEGORY_NAME, p.EXPERIENCE) AS total_count
    FROM PROJECTS p
    JOIN CATEGORY c 
        ON p.PROJECT_ID = c.CATEGORY_ID
    WHERE p.EXPERIENCE IN ('Entry', 'Expert')
),
median_calc AS (
    SELECT 
        CATEGORY_NAME, 
        EXPERIENCE,
        CASE 
            WHEN total_count % 2 = 1 
                THEN CAST(
                    MAX(CASE WHEN rn = (total_count + 1) / 2 THEN BUDGET END) AS DECIMAL(10,2)
                )
            ELSE 
                CAST(
                    (MAX(CASE WHEN rn = total_count / 2 THEN BUDGET END) +
                     MAX(CASE WHEN rn = (total_count / 2) + 1 THEN BUDGET END)) / 2.0 AS DECIMAL(10,2)
                )
        END AS MEDIAN_BUDGET
    FROM ranked
    GROUP BY CATEGORY_NAME, EXPERIENCE, total_count
),
pivot AS (
    SELECT 
        category_name,
        MAX(CASE WHEN experience = 'Expert' THEN median_budget END) AS expert_median,
        MAX(CASE WHEN experience = 'Entry' THEN median_budget END) AS entry_median 
    FROM median_calc
    GROUP BY category_name
)
SELECT 
    category_name,
    expert_median,
    entry_median, 
    ROUND(((expert_median - entry_median)/entry_median)*100) AS pct_increase 
FROM pivot;
```

```sql
WITH subcat_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        c.sub_category_name,
        COUNT(p.project_id) AS total_postings,
        SUM(p.budget) AS total_budget
    FROM category c
    JOIN projects p 
        ON c.category_id = p.project_id
    GROUP BY c.sub_category_name
),
overall_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        SUM(total_postings) AS grand_total_postings
    FROM subcat_stats
),
filtered_subcats AS (
    SELECT 
        s.sub_category_name,
        s.total_postings,
        s.total_budget,
        (s.total_postings * 100.0 / o.grand_total_postings) AS posting_percentage
    FROM subcat_stats s
    CROSS JOIN overall_stats o 
    WHERE (s.total_postings * 100.0 / o.grand_total_postings) < 5
)
SELECT 
    sub_category_name,
    total_postings,
    posting_percentage,
    total_budget
FROM filtered_subcats
ORDER BY total_budget DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### Insights:
- Videography stands out as the top contributor, accounting for just 2.49% of total postings yet driving the highest budget allocation of $151,465.

- Mobile App Development follows closely, making up 1.88% of postings but contributing a significant $138,440 in total budget.

- Management & Development, despite only 1.03% of postings, still commands $124,657, showing high-value allocation relative to its low posting share.


### 3. High-Value Locations with Few Postings
```sql
WITH average AS (
    SELECT AVG(Budget) AS avg_budget_overall
    FROM projects
)
SELECT 
    Freelancer_Preferred_From,
    COUNT(*) AS total_postings,
    AVG(Budget) AS avg_budget,
    a.avg_budget_overall
FROM projects
CROSS JOIN average a
GROUP BY Freelancer_Preferred_From, a.avg_budget_overall
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) < 0.05 * (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects) 
    AND AVG(Budget) > a.avg_budget_overall
ORDER BY avg_budget DESC;
```

### Insights
- United States has a large budget advantage with an average of $970/project across 90 postings, making it the most promising sizeable market.

- Germany is another attractive market, with just 4 postings averaging $770/project, well above the global average.

- United Kingdom, despite 578 postings, still qualifies with an average of $405/project, showing strong budget capacity, but the higher posting count means competition is likely stronger.

- Smaller-volume countries like Algeria($340), Philippines($318), Uganda( $300), and Sweden ($300) each have fewer than 10 postings yet show above-average budgets per projects, indicating micro-market opportunities.


### 4. Industries with Shortest Lead Times
```sql
WITH JOINS AS (
    SELECT 
        ca.category_name AS industry,
        p.Date_Only,
        c.client_registration_date_new
    FROM PROJECTS p
    JOIN CLIENTS c 
        ON p.CLIENT_ID = c.CLIENT_ID
    JOIN CATEGORY ca 
        ON p.PROJECT_ID = ca.CATEGORY_ID
)
SELECT 
    j.industry,
    AVG(DATEDIFF(j.Date_Only, j.client_registration_date_new)) AS avg_days_difference
FROM JOINS j
GROUP BY j.industry
ORDER BY avg_days_difference ASC;
```
### Insights
